# unlucid
Unlucid is a metroidvania I made for a month long game jam and it won the community choice award!
please note that this is not the completed version of unlucid because i am stupid and i lost the files for it. this one is the copy of the game 3 days before completion of the jam.

this runs on GMS 2.2
